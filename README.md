Spoilt for choice? With such a large variety of wine in the shelves of your local supermarket, how can you make an informed decision to enjoy a lovely drink without becoming a pseudo alcoholic?

This is a mini project for CZ1115 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, which aims to predict the wine quality from the physicochemical properties of wine.
